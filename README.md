# Project: Restaurant Success Model
## A model that predicts if a restaurant is likely to close within the next 4 years.

### Project Description

The Restaurant Success Analysis project aimed to construct a predictive model determining the likelihood of a restaurant closure within a 4-year period, offering valuable insights for restaurant lenders and investors. The project initiated with meticulous data curation, leveraging the Yelp Search API and Google Search API to compile a robust dataset. Through iterative steps, including data validation and feature engineering, relevant attributes were extracted to fuel model development. Implemented within a series of Jupyter notebooks, the project's workflow seamlessly transitioned from data acquisition to model evaluation. Notably, logistic regression and gradient boosting emerged as the most effective models for predicting restaurant closure, showcasing the project's data-driven approach. The comprehensive documentation of methodologies and outcomes within the provided notebooks ensures transparency and reproducibility, offering invaluable resources for stakeholders in the restaurant industry. For a deeper dive into the project's methodology and insights, a detailed blog post further elucidates its significance within the realm of data science.
